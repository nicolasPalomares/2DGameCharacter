# 2D Videogame Character

This program simulates character movement in a 2D video game, utilizing sprites sourced from https://itch.io/game-assets/free.

## Features

 * Game Loop: Continuously renders and updates frames and images to create a nice gameplay experience.
 * User Interface: Incorporates a panel and a main frame for game management.
 * Collision Detection: Implements rectangular hitboxes for both the character and the map, ensuring realistic interactions. The character's hitbox "bounces" off walls and the floor, enhancing the game's physical dynamics.
