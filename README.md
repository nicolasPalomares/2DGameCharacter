This program recreates a character movement in a 2D videogame. The sprites for the character were taken from https://itch.io/game-assets/free.

 * The window runs through a game loop that renders and update the frames and images.
 * The character moves left and right (with 'A' and 'D') through keyboard inputs.
 * The program works with a panel and a main frame.
 * The character and map hitboxes were programmed with rectangles and collision. The character hitbox "bounces" whith the walls and the floor.
